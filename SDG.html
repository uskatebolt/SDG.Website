          <h2 style=color:black>More Info About Ironfertilizatopn and SDG 14.5</h2>
          <p>It started back in the 1930s scientist Joseph Hart has discovered desolate zones. These are areas of the Ocean that are rich in nutrients and but lack phytoplankton and other marine life. It is the sea life that makes an ecosystem thrive and without the right inhabitance, any ecosystem can suffer. The zones do not help global warming due to the diminishing population of the phytoplankton. <a href="https://courses.lumenlearning.com/boundless-microbiology/chapter/nutrient-cycles/" target="_blank">(Lumen Learning, 2015) </a> He concluded that these zones are iron deficient. Phytoplankton is the base of the marine food chain. Like other plants, they use photosynthesis to absorb carbon dioxide. Iron is the key element in every plant’s photosynthetic mechanism. After observing the deficiency of iron in these areas scientist John Griffin suggested adding large amounts of soluble iron to the desolate zones. One kilogram of iron increased the phytoplankton biomass by up to 100,000 kilograms. In 1995 a team of American oceanographers added half a ton of iron solute to a desolate zone in the south pacific.  A small area of phytoplankton absorbed an additional 7000 tons of carbon dioxide. This is the equivalent amount of absorption undergone by 200 Redwood trees. (the world’s biggest tree). <a href= "https://youtu.be/sPRKLpDdM0s" target="_blank">(Smith,2013)</a> Ocean fertilization is very efficient and useful. When people think of stopping climate change very rarely do they think about the ocean.</p>

          <h2 style=color:black>What is SDG 14.5</h2>
          <p>According to the official Sustainability Development Goals website it is the expansion of protected areas for marine biodiversity and existing policies and treaties that encourage responsible use of ocean resources are still insufficient to combat the adverse effects of overfishing, growing ocean acidification due to climate change and worsening coastal eutrophication. As billions of people depend on oceans for their livelihood and food source and on the transboundary nature of oceans, increased efforts and interventions are needed to conserve and sustainably use ocean resources at all levels. 
              We need to protect areas of our ocean the same way we would to for land. People forget the importance of the ocean and the danger of not protecting it since theyre not actually living it. Once ocean life is gone there is no getting it back and we must act now. Proteting specific areas and implementing the Iron fertilization will saver our ocean which is as important or even more important then our land as it accounts for 71% of our Earth.

          <h2 style=color:black>Facts:</h2>
          <ul>
            <li> Over one million seabirds are killed by ocean pollution each year. Three hundred thousand dolphins and porpoises die each year as a result of becoming entangled in discarded fishing nets, among other items. One hundred thousand sea mammals are killed in the ocean by pollution each year.</li>
            <li>Fertilizer runoff creates eutrophication that flourishes algal bloom (rapid increase or accumulation in the population of algae in aquatic systems) which depletes the oxygen content in the water that affects marine life.</li>
            <li> As 70% of the earth is covered with water, people actually assumed that all pollutants would be diluted and get disappeared. But in reality, they have not disappeared and their effects can be easily seen as they have entered the food chain.</li>
            <li>Since 1950, 1% of plankton has decreased every year. That means from 1960 over 40% of plankton has decreased and soon enough the plankton population as a whole can reach extinct. </li>
            <li>Adding 1 kilogram of iron solute into the ocean can provide nutrition for 100,000 km² of phytoplankton. </li>
          </ul>
          <p>The ocean remains one of the most expansive, mysterious and diverse places on Earth. Unfortunately, it is being threatened by pollution from people on land and from natural causes. Marine life is dying, and as a result the whole oceanic ecosystem is threatened simply by various sources of pollution. If we are to preserve ocean and its natural beauty, drastic measures have to be taken to combat this pollution and keep what we hold most dear. </p>

              <h2>Affects on Ocean life</h2>
              <p> Ocean pollution has a very severe effect on marine life. Overfishing may be a problem and with the increase of the human population leading to the depletion of fish population. Phytoplankton is the base of the marine food chain. Without it, the entire food chain will be destroyed. When the phytoplankton goes extinct the fish will follow suit. (Oceaneos,2017) Research has shown that the iron dust emitted from volcanic eruptions creates a huge increase in the fish population for the next year. For example, researchers added iron dust to a section of the river where salmon travel during migration. One year later the river experienced one of the largest salmon population returns ever. (Oceaneos,2017) Multiple repetitions of this test have been run and the same re</p>

              <h2>What You Could do to Help</h2>
              <p>The UN doesnt seem to understand the importance of this SDG and Iron fertilization. As a community we need to conduct more experiments and tests so we have proof for the UN that we need to act abruptly. Research the importance of iron fertilization. The more voices we have the better. Change can start with a quick google search</p>
